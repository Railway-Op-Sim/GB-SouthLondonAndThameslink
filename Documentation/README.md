# South London and Thameslink

This project contains some commuter lines in South London, generally, those nested within the two branches of the Brighton Main Line.

Services along the routes is made up of:
- High-Frequency London Overground services, both via Denmark Hill and to/from Crystal Palace.
- Commuter Southeastern and Southern services via Tulse Hill and Herne Hill.
- Express Southeastern services to Kent, via Herne Hill.
- Thameslink services from Blackfriars to the South.

## Simulation

The timetable runs from 0558 to about 1200. Below are a few tips that you may find useful for operating this route.

A session file is included in the download, which contains a few extra "blue" routes set.

### Some tips for Operation

- Check SE services via Nunhead as some go via Clapham High Street and on the LO lines.
- Double check which element is required for the Wandsworth portal, some SE services need the central (reversible) portal.
- Several services have long wait times at some stations. Do not hesitate to delay these if needed.
